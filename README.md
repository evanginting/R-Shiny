# ETC5523 Assessment 1

This is a **National Football League** app that was created using [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) for the ETC5523 Assessment 1. 

* The creator of this app is **Evan Ginting**.
* The data used for this assessment is the `NFL Stadium attendance` data which can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-02-04). 

The goal of the app is to give preliminary information to the new NFL supporter, so they know a little bit background around the sports in general.

The link to the app can be found at [https://evanginting.shinyapps.io/National-Football-League_App/](https://evanginting.shinyapps.io/National-Football-League_App/)
